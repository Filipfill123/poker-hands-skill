Tells you whether your hand is a pair. 

## About
My first skill test to find out how it really works. idea is that it tells you whether your hand is a pair or no apir (ace + ace = pair, ace + king = no pair). The skill also has a basic state representation, which can be used if Mycroft did not understand the first, the second or both cards. If the skill has not all the neccessary information, it will ask the user to complete it. The user also has an option of seeing skill's state representation and deleting it.

## Examples
* "What is ace and ace"
* "What is ace and king?"
* "Show me your state representation"
* "Delete/Kill your state representation"
